    "In this course, we will learn how to construct various machine learning algorithms from scratch. In the real world, however, we don’t want to recreate a complex algorithm every time we want to use it. Writing an algorithm from scratch is a great way to understand the fundamental principles of why it works, but we may not get the efficiency or reliability we need.\n",

    "Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms. It’s built upon some of the technology you might already be familiar with, like NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib!\n",

    "\n",
    "- Regression, including Linear and Logistic Regression\n",
    "- Classification, including K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "- Clustering, including K-Means and K-Means++\n",
    "- Model selection\n",
    "- Preprocessing, including Min-Max Normalization\n",
